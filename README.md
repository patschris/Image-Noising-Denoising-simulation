# Image Noising/Denoising Simulation
The goal of this simulation is to try some of the basic methods of the image processing. We are using the images *duck.jpg*, *puppy.jpg*, *wrenches.jpg* and *matlab.jpg* for our tests (folder [images](https://github.com/patschris/Image-Noising-Denoising-simulation/tree/master/images)).<br/> 

Main concepts:
- reduce the quantization level
- downsampling
- add white gausian and salt & pepper noise and then try to remove it by using filters
- use non linear based on mean value filters
- use custom filters
- make the image black and white using thresholds
- seperate images in red, green and blue components.

<br/>For the implementation we used Matlab R2015a in Windows 10.
